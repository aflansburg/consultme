introduction: |
  Hi, I'm **Abram Flansburg** - Abe for short. I'm a musically inclined technologist working as a Principal Engineer in Healthcare, primarily on AI applications.

  I'm a child of adoption and spent some of my earliest years in foster homes. Adoption was a huge blessing for me as I was rescued from a very bad situation. I've been on my own since I was 17 and paid for 100% of my higher education with full-time and part-time jobs. I dropped out of college after a year in order to save money to go to college - is that some weird form of recursion?

academic: |
  Academically, there is not much to note. I've studied a broad range of subjects from Psychology to Mathematics. I hold a B.S. in CIS and have a post-graduate certificate in data science & business analytics. I'm constantly researching and learning independently from my job, but also as part of it!

professional: |
  Professionally, I pivoted from a short stint in procurement & procurement engineering into a career of software, data, infrastructure, & platform engineering. I prefer to wear many hats, and doing so has allowed me to learn how everything 'works under the hood'. Once you understand the most basic principles and mechanisms, it becomes quite easy to manipulate, deconstruct, or build using these insights.

musical: |
  I've taught myself several musical instruments, but as a kid had the privilege of studying both violin and piano. I picked up guitar and percussion along the way and love to dabble in musical composition & digital music production (see my [Work](/work) page).

family: |
  From the family side, my wife Ashley and I have been together since we were in our late teens / early twenties and have struggled, but we wouldn't trade that experience for anything. Out of the tough years and the really good ones we had two awesome kids who are super smart, talented, and empathetic people.

beliefs:
  intro: |
    My household believes in God and His Son Yeshua and because of that we believe in:
  values:
    - Loving others
    - Treating everyone the way we want to be treated
    - Not favoring any person over another or treating anyone differently because they think, look, believe, or live differently from us, or hail from a different part of this planet we all share
  additional:
    - We do not weaponize our beliefs against anyone
    - Are not part of any hive-minded mentalities
    - Have no allegiance to political parties

closing: |
  If you read all of this, I have to wonder why? If you did I appreciate it and it gives you some amount of insight into who I am, but I'm always happy to meet new people and chat, so feel free to reach out! ;)
